Description: demoR facilitates easier formatting of R
    source code in a R Markdown-based presentation. The main goal of the
    package is to allow users to preserve their code creation process
    within code chunks, then to specifiy formatting details for the source
    code, such as highlighting of particular syntatical elements.
